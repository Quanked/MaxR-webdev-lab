## Reflection Document

### HTML

I was able to complete the exercises on my own, but I had to return to them to fix some small errors. The lessons were generally very helpful, no specific key helpful one. This leson was explained quite well. This topic was quite simple so it no extra exercises are required in my opinion.

### Accessibility

I was able to complete the exercises on my one, but I actually missed this assignment until near the end. This one was nice to learning how to tackle Web aim issues. It's missing an explanation as to what to do though, should have one included.

### CSS

I was able to complete these exercises on my own, but I consitered them quite difficult. They were helpful, generally, but sometimes obtuse. I wish they was a more gradual introduction into what you should be modifing, like a "Please modify these particular given CSS elements" as a first step. More of these I think would help.

### Flexbox

I was able to complete these exercises on my own, again, quite a difficult one too. This one was helpful, but weird. It was structure in a way that, it was all wrapped in one file. I feel like I got a lot of expreince with flex boxes, but there was less of build up here, and more of just shifting existing boxes around. Though, flexbox is not particually difficult.

### CS Grid

This assignemt felt very similar to Flexbox. Again, completed on my own, and helpful, but less of a build up and more of a number of assignments to complete. I guess what I mean to say is that both Flexbox and CS Grid feel like busy work. They are useful, but feel very very repetative.

### Bootstap

Bootstrapping is where things got a tad challenging, but still completed on my own. I remember relying on a lot of online resouces, some bootstap cheatsheets. I was reminded that some cheatsheets for some of the content in this class would be amazing. Beyond notes and slides. I so badly want these kind of references, so I go to extra websites and then do things slightly different.

### Javascript

Javascript is where I started reling on the video solutions for help. I found the challenges really difficult, and didnt feel super confident in my attempts. The section was helpful in understanding javascript, but it still remains challenging to me. I found the examples in the lab demos pretty helpful too. Again, I think more simple step ups would have helped, a hello world to start, with more steps.

### Jquery

Similar to the javascript section, I relied on the video solutions to solve this the section. The challenges were difficult, and I didnt feel confident with my jquery work. Honestly I still dont feel confident, mainly due to the work being very dense. I feel like there needs more exercises to work on, 2 exercises compared to Javascripts 7.
